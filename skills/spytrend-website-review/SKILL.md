  Review one website or store domain with SpyTrend MCP data: monthly traffic
  estimate, advertising footprint over time, which advertiser pages run ads to
  it and its leading creatives, from a database of 1B+ tracked Meta ads. Use
  when the user gives a domain or URL and wants its traffic, whether and since
  when it runs ads, who sends paid traffic to it, or how its ad volume changed
  month by month. Also use when the user mentions "store spy," "does this site
  run ads," "how much traffic does this store get," "check this domain: traffic,
  ads, creatives," "competitor website traffic," "ads that lead to this domain,"
  "is this store ad-driven or organic," or pastes a store link asking for
  advertising research. Always use this instead of guessing when asked about a
  specific site's ads or traffic. Not for discovering new stores (use
  spytrend-shop-discovery), whole niches (use spytrend-vertical-intel) or the
  operation behind the ads (use spytrend-webmaster-overview).

# SpyTrend website advertising review

Read `references/spytrend-contract.md` before making any data call.

## Normalize and preflight

1. Accept one domain, remove scheme, path and leading `www`, and preserve the
   user's exact input as context. Reject credentials and IP-literal targets.
2. Call `get_usage`. State explicit seed limits, profile cap, media count and
   worst-case spend.
3. Default media to off. Do not download or inspect the website itself.

## Workflow

1. Call `search_shops` with the domain, optional selected `country` and a small
   explicit limit. Match the exact host or registrable root deliberately and
   state which scope was selected.
2. Call `get_shop` for the primary returned surface. Extract only bounded public
   fields. Traffic history is a monthly estimate for its stated month.
3. Label `ads_monthly` as ads first discovered by SpyTrend. It is not a Facebook
   launch series. Mark the open current month incomplete.
4. For a closed launch window, call `search_ads` with `landing_domain`,
   `landing_domain_exact=true`, optional selected `country`, concrete dates and
   a one-row limit, then use
   `pagination.total` only with its date-axis
   and total status. If launch-period analytics are unavailable, say so; do not
   substitute the discovery series.
5. Call `search_webmasters` by exact domain with optional selected `countries`
   and a small limit; present matches as observed advertising-network
   attribution, not ownership.
6. Call one bounded `search_ads` seed page per selected surface with
   `landing_domain_exact=true` and optional selected `country`. Use its total for
   volume and its returned rows only to discover advertiser candidates. Cap
   advertiser cards, call `get_advertiser` for only those unique ids, and
   report processed-versus-seen coverage. A card without a `card_status` field
   is complete; `card_status=building` means the card is a placeholder whose
   counters are unavailable, not zero.
7. For website-scoped creative reuse, call `search_ads` again with the exact
   domain/country/date filters and `sort_by=most_reused_creative`, using a small
   selection: on a high-volume domain this ranking exceeds the analytics deadline
   and returns a timeout instead of rows. Always pair it with a concrete date
   window, and add the selected country when the domain is large; widen only if
   the bounded call returned rows. Report the bound you used. Also treat the
   two reuse counters as separate measurements: when
   `same_creative_ads_in_selection` exceeds `same_creative_ads_lifetime`, report
   both as returned and do not present the pair as a subset relation.
   explicit limit. Its representative ads and selection reuse counts are the
   website-scoped ranking. Do not substitute a country-global
   `search_creatives` page or re-sort a bounded lifetime list.
8. With confirmation, retrieve media once for the selected representative ad ids
   and reuse it in every report section.

## Report

Keep Markdown and HTML sections equivalent: website snapshot, traffic period and
quality, advertising volume, advertisers, networks, creative leaders, coverage,
period-axis notes and spend. A different landing domain is a returned fact, not
proof that businesses are unrelated.

Use `references/report-template.md` or the packaged renderer with
`references/report-template.html`; otherwise provide the full report in chat.
