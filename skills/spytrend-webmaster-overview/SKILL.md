description: >-
  Profile the advertising network behind a domain or a group of ads with
  SpyTrend MCP data: connected domains, advertiser pages, identifiers tying ads
  to one operator, target countries and the creatives that operation reuses
  most, from a database of 1B+ tracked Meta ads. Use when the user wants to know
  who is behind a set of ads, see everything one operator or competitor runs
  across pages and domains, or check whether identical ads on different pages
  belong to one player. Also use when the user mentions "ads spy across pages,"
  "who is behind these ads," "everything this operator runs," "same company
  running ads across pages," "what other domains does this advertiser operate,"
  "the whole operation," "network behind a landing domain," or "trace who
  launched these ads." Not for ranking advertiser pages in a market (use
  spytrend-advertiser-overview) and not for a website's traffic review (use
  spytrend-website-review).

  «вся связка страниц оператора».

# SpyTrend advertising network overview

Read `references/spytrend-contract.md` before making any data call. The skill
name preserves the MCP entity name for routing; user-facing output says
"advertising network" or "network".

## Resolve one network

1. Call `get_usage` and disclose the planned depth and media choice.
2. If the input is not already a canonical id, call `search_webmasters` by exact
   domain or query with a small limit. Show ambiguous candidates and ask the user
   to choose rather than merging them.
3. Read market size from `pagination.total` only with its status. Never read a
   top-level total and never promise a complete list from a capped response.
4. Call `get_webmaster` with the chosen canonical id. If
   `analytics_pending=true`, treat counters as pending, not zero.

## Bounded profile

1. Render the returned domains, advertiser pages, the identifiers that tie ads
   to one operator, and countries with their returned counts, caps and statuses. A missing inventory is unavailable,
   not proof that no identifier exists.
2. Present attribution edges as evidence of observed combinations. A small edge
   does not prove common ownership, and inherited identifiers do not describe
   current operation by themselves.
3. Call `search_creatives` with `webmaster_id`, optional category and
   `sort_by=total_ads` for the exact global network slice. Do not add `country`:
   the current read path cannot preserve the exact network slice together with
   that filter. Use returned geo fields as context, not as a country ranking.
4. Call `search_ads` with `webmaster_id`, the selected `categories` and
   `countries`, `country_match=any`, `status_today=active`, `sort_by=date`,
   `dedupe=true` and a small explicit limit for fresh examples. This means the
   selected country is present in the ad's known geographies; it does not mean
   that country is dominant. Label dates according to the returned date axis.
5. If the card contains a network-specific creative slice, use its slice order
   for "most reused by this network". Keep market-wide family size as separate
   context; do not use it to reorder the network slice.
6. With confirmation, retrieve media for only the chosen rows. A representative
   ad is a cheaper placement example; a creative fetch represents the material
   family. State which path was used.

## Report

Include resolution evidence, current/pending status, returned identifier
coverage, country activity, creative rankings, fresh examples, period labels and
spend. Say "processed N of M" whenever a bounded cap is used.

Use `references/report-template.md` or the packaged renderer with
`references/report-template.html`; otherwise return the same report in chat.
