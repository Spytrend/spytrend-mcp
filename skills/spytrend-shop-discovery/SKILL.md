# SpyTrend shop discovery

Read `references/spytrend-contract.md` before making any data call.

## Inputs

- Require at least one of vertical or ISO-2 country.
- Platform is optional. Omit the parameter for "any platform"; never send a
  made-up wildcard value.
- Default: five admitted rows per cut, up to three store drilldowns, chat output,
  media off.

## Preflight

Call `get_usage`, state the three page limits, drilldown cap, media choice and
worst-case spend. Decide whether domain scope is exact host or root plus
subdomains and label it.

## Workflow

1. Call `search_shops` three times with the same filters and separate server
   sorts: traffic, qualified growth, and advertising activity. Never re-sort one
   bounded page to manufacture another cut.
2. Apply the public quality fields returned by the service. Reject infrastructure
   and redirect surfaces. Preserve server order among admitted rows.
3. If filtering leaves fewer rows than requested, page forward with the returned
   offset only until the target is filled or three pages have been inspected.
   Report fetched, admitted and rendered counts. Never promise implicit top-up.
4. Traffic is a monthly estimate for `traffic_as_of`. Growth is shown only when
   qualified. `ads_monthly` counts ads first discovered by SpyTrend; it is not a
   platform-launch series, and the open month is incomplete.
5. Select at most one unique admitted store from each cut for drilldown. For each,
   use `search_ads` with `landing_domain_exact=true`, the exact domain and
   concrete dates for a bounded count and representative ads. Use the response's
   total status and date axis.
6. Use the server's selected-window creative reuse ordering when available. Keep
   window reuse and lifetime reuse separate.
7. Call advertiser cards only for unique returned advertiser ids and
   `search_webmasters` by exact domain with a small limit for advertising-network
   attribution. A card without a `card_status` field is complete;
   `card_status=building` means its counters are unavailable, not zero.
8. With confirmation, fetch media only for the representative ads in the final
   drilldowns.

## Report

Show each cut independently, monthly estimate period, first-discovery label,
quality admission, fetched/admitted coverage, store drilldowns, unavailable
sections and spend. A domain surface is not automatically a brand or company.

Use `references/report-template.md` or the packaged renderer with
`references/report-template.html`; otherwise provide the complete result in
chat.
